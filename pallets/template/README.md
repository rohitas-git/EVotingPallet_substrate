This is Rust code for a pallet module in a Substrate-based blockchain. A pallet is a modular component in Substrate that encapsulates a specific set of functionalities. This pallet seems to be a basic implementation of a voting system for an election.

The pallet has three main data structures defined using Rust structs: VoterInfo, CandidateInfo, and ElectionInfo. VoterInfo contains information about whether a voter has voted and who they voted for (if they have voted). CandidateInfo contains the vote count for a candidate. ElectionInfo contains the start and end block numbers for an election.

The pallet has several storage items that are used to store the data structures mentioned above. AccountToVoterInfo maps an account ID to a VoterInfo struct. AccountToCandidateInfo maps an account ID to a CandidateInfo struct. ElectionConfig stores an ElectionInfo struct that contains the start and end block numbers for an election.

The pallet has five events: RegisterVoter, RegisterCandidate, VoteSuccess, RecieveVoteCount, and ElectionConfigured.

The pallet has four dispatchable functions: register_voter, register_candidate, vote, and configure_election. register_voter adds a voter to the AccountToVoterInfo storage item if they haven't already been added. register_candidate adds a candidate to the AccountToCandidateInfo storage item if they haven't already been added. vote allows a voter to vote for a candidate. configure_election sets the start and end block numbers for an election.
